## Welcome *ablog*

I will use the GitHub Pages to write what am I generally experiencing as **Machine Learning Analyst** and **Prediction Engineer**.

Note that I am avoding to use word **Data Scientist**. The reason is twofold:
- the term became an "unicorn" position and the buzz-word
- real Data Scientist should have knowledge of the following things:
  - good understanding of math and statistics
  - programming languages: Python/R, SQL, etc.
  - knowledge of machine learning models
  - business/industry-relevant domain knowledge

I could say that I cover the first three with more-or-less some experience (SQL being the most vague one). However, as applied physicsist I do not have real money-making domain. Hence I do not see myself as Data Scientist (yet!).

### Jekyll Themes
Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/vlaki1989/vlaki1989.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
