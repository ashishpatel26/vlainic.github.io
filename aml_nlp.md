## [E.2] AML - Natural Language Processing: Telegram Chat-bot

*Here, I am continuing my blog on Education with one more additional set of advice.*

In general, the course [Advanced Machine Learning specialization - Natural Language Processing](https://www.coursera.org/learn/language-processing/home/welcome) is by far the best one in the whole specialization. Very nice lectures, explanations, and guides in practical assignments.

However, during doing the last project - making a chatbot for Telegram - I encountered some issues with AWS/Docker setup while doing as explained by the instructors.

Note that most of the things I have written here can be found in the course forum, but I want to share it at one place :)

### Installing on AWS

Instead of classical *sudo-follow-up* command for installation from terminal

    apt-get

you need to use :

    yum

and this you can find on [AWS guide for Docker installation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/docker-basics.html).

### Docker python3 run killed

Even though I had only 112 thousand embedded words, 1GB memory on AWS machine did not show to be enough for my chatbot to load. Practically this happened:

![bot_killed_1](/images/bot_killed_1.png)

The solution I found that works for me is **swapping**. Most of the practical commands can be found on [this link](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-add-swap-space-on-ubuntu-16-04), while *fallocate* line should be changed with *dd* line [from here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/questions/sudo-swapon-swapfile-error).

Essentially all you need to run is:

    sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile count=4096 bs=1MiB
    sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
    sudo mkswap /swapfile
    sudo swapon /swapfile

You can also make swap permanent and tweak its parameters as it is explained in [the main swap link](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-add-swap-space-on-ubuntu-16-04).

**Note:** while choosing memory amount, I did not manage to have bs=1G, with count=1. Instead, to add 1GB you need to type bs=1M with count=1024

### AWS - more memory!!!

I tried to swap with 2GB, but it was not enough. This was maximum possible, as AWS had 8GB of storage.

So I had to increase AWS storage. This was done while making Instance as followed from [AWS instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html#ec2-launch-instance) and then before Step 5, I would go "Next: ...." until I do not end up on the storage page. Here I set 30GB (which is maximum for Free Tier!!!) instead of 8GB. Than 15000-20000 counts with bs=1M did the job B-)

## ASCII error

When running, there was an error (do not mind the numbers):

    UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character '\xe9' in position 215

The solution can be found in [the course forum](https://www.coursera.org/learn/language-processing/discussions/weeks/5/threads/M3o3rEl8Eei3QRJgAj5qBg), and you just need to run following line

    export PYTHONIOENCODING=UTF-8

before running main_bot.py.
